It is wise to make rational decision in the time of despair, because emotion based decision cost heavely to decision maker itself and emotions can't be trusted because it changes periodically and situation wise. So be conscious in making a decision when you are low in compousure. It is always better to consult who have more experience.
If you are left behind due to irrational decision due to changing emotions, then you will be alienated like aliens.
